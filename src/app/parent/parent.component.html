<h1>From parent component</h1>

<p>we have removed the default root component and made our own root component <br>
    View Encapsulation - making changes in any component css will affect only that component. <br>
    we can take component as tags or as selector. <br>
    to make it class selector, put a . before class name in ts file <br>
